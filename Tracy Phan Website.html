		<p>I am an undergraduate student at San Jose State University and currently major in art with a concentration in photography. I have been doing photography for about 4 years now and have learned to use programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom to edit my photos. Through art classes at SJSU, I have also learned how to create other types of New Media art by using programs such as Mesh Mixer, Premiere, and Audacity.<br><br>I don't have a specific "inspiration" for my art. However, I do have a liking to light and enjoy using it in my projects. Most of my work comes from a spontaneous idea I had or comes from how I felt at that moment.
